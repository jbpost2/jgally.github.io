## This is my first blog post
So my first assignment of the new semester is to answer a couple of questions about data scientists.

What do you think being a data scientist is about?  What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?  


   Being a data scientist is a more exploratory way of solving real world problems with new technology such as machine learning. Some of the many duties of being a data scientist would include prepping/ cleansing data, data manipulation, analysis/ summarizing, and sharing ideas. Data scientist need to be knowledgeable in technical, analytical, and soft skills in order to fulfill their duties. While statisticians and data scientist have some overlap, there are noticeable differences between the two professions. Staticians focus on statistical modeling and fitting the data to the models, whereas data scientists try to solve problems by fitting models to the data. With constant updates and new technology, data scientist are able to create more questions and spark more creativity than staticians would. Personally, I enjoy both statistics and data science. I grew up learning statistics so I am far more comfortable with that field; however, the newness of data science has piqued my interest. Even after the first couple of videos of the semester, I am excited to apply the course concepts and continue on my journey of data science!
